### Continuous Deployment with Jenkins ###

In this lab, you will learn how to deploy the Parts Unlimited MRP App in an automated fashion onto a Linux VM with no agent.
After this lab, you will have a working, automated pipeline in Jenkins that will build, test, and deploy the Parts Unlimited MRP app to a Virtual Machine in Azure.

### Pre-Requisites: ###

- Completion of the [Set up Parts Unlimited MRP with Jenkins](2017-08-22-fund-10-Oth-prereq.md)
- Completion of the [Continuous Integration with Jenkins lab](2017-08-22-fund-11-Oth-CI.md)

### Tasks Overview:
During this lab, we will implement the continuous delivery of the artifacts that we have build in the previous lab. 

### Task 1: Install the SSH Agent plugin 
In this task, we are going to install the ssh-agent plugin on Jenkins. This plugin will allow Jenkins to connect via ssh to the target machine and deploy the artifacts.

**1.** Switch to the SSH session to your Jenkins server (or open a new one if you have closed the one from the previous lab) and type the following command
```sh
sudo java -jar /var/cache/jenkins/war/WEB-INF/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://jenkins:Passw0rd@127.0.0.1:8080/ install-plugin ssh-agent
```

* The result should be

```
Installing ssh-agent from update center
```
**Note:** Remember to create a Tunnel to localhost:8080 (following the steps from the pre-requisite lab) when connecting using Putty, otherwise you will not be able to login to Jenkins.

**2.** Restart the Jenkins server so that the newly installed plugin becomes active. 

* From the Jenkins Master, type the following command: 

```sh
sudo java -jar /var/cache/jenkins/war/WEB-INF/jenkins-cli.jar -s http://jenkins:Passw0rd@localhost:8080/ safe-restart
```

* Keep your ssh session open.

### Task 2: Create a pair of SSH keys
In this task, we will create a pair of ssh keys to be able to automatically connect to the deployment server. 

**1.** Type the following command on the SSH Session: 

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

**2.** Press **Enter** to leave the default values for the filename and the passphrase.

![Creating a new ssh-rsa keypair](<../assets/jenkins/ssh_key.png>)

**3.** Copy the private key file to /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh by typing the following commands:

```bash
sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/
sudo chown jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
sudo cp .ssh/id_rsa /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa
sudo chown jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**4.** Create a Jenkins credentials

* Using the browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080` and login.

* Because of the restart, you may have to authenticate again with the following credentials:
> * Username = jenkins
> * Password = Passw0rd

* After logging in navigate to
```
http://localhost:8080/credentials/store/system/domain/_/newCredentials
```



**5.** Enter the values for the credentials as follows

* Select **SSH Username with private key** for the Kind 
* Leave the scope as "Global"
* Type **mrpadmin** for the Username
* Select **From the Jenkins master ~/.ssh**
* Leave the Passphrase empty
* Type **mrpadmin** for the ID 
* Click **OK**

### Task 3: Create the VM to run the Parts Unlimited MRP application 

**1.** From your SSH session type the following
```
cat ./.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

* Select the text returned, so it will be copied to the clipboard, we will use it in step 3. 

![Copy SSH public key](<../assets/jenkins/copy_sshpublickey.png>)

**2.** Open the following URL in your browser to start deploying the MRP virtual machine resources to Azure.
```
https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FPartsUnlimitedMRP%2Fmaster%2Fdocs%2Fassets%2Fjenkins%2Fenv%2FContinuousDeploymentPartsUnlimitedMRP.json
```

**3.** Enter the values as follows

* Select the subscription that you want to use for the deployment.
* Check **Create new** for the resource group.
* Resource Group: **mrp-deploy** (or a name of your choice)
* Use the location of your choice 
* Mrp Admin Username: **mrpadmin** 
* Mrp Dns Name for Public IP: Use the name you want, this name has to be unique. 
* Admin Public Key: Paste the string that you have copied in step 1.
* Scroll down to agree on the terms and conditions.
* Click **Purchase** to start the deployment.

**Note:** This deployment may take several minutes due the post deploy script that will install all necessary pre-requisites on the virtual machine. Please wait for the deployment be complete before executing the next steps.

![Deploy MRP VM](<../assets/jenkins/mrp_arm_deploy.png>)

**NOTE:** write down the FQDN of your newly deployed virtual machine, we will call it MRP machine. 
You can get it via the same steps that in this lab [Set up Parts Unlimited MRP with Jenkins](./2017-08-22-fund-10-Oth-prereq.html). It should take the following form `
 nanme_specified_above.region_selected.cloudapp.azure.com`

### Task 4: Update the Jenkins pipeline

In this task we will update the Jenkins pipeline to automatically deploy the artifacts after they have been build.

* Navigate to the configuration of your pipeline:

```
http://localhost:8080/job/PartsUnlimitedMRP/configure
```

* In the pipeline, go to the end of the script (line 31) and **before the last line** (the trailing "}" shall be behing this added code, insert the following code. 

```js
    stage ('Save MongoRecords.js') {
        dir('deploy') {
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'MongoRecords.js', excludes: '**/docker'
        }
    }

    def mrphostname
    
    stage ('Get MRP hostname') { 
        mrphostname = input(
            id: 'mrhphostname', message: 'Please enter the MRP VM FQDN', parameters: [
                [$class: 'TextParameterDefinition', defaultValue: 'mrp-deploy.westus.cloudapp.azure.com', description: 'This is the FQDN by which the VM can be remotely accessed', name: 'mrphostname']
                ])
        echo ("MRP HostName: ${mrphostname}")
    }
    
     stage ("ssh") {
        sshagent(['mrpadmin']) {
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin ${mrphostname} 'curl -O ${env.BUILD_URL} artifact/build/libs/mrp.war'"
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin  ${mrphostname} 'curl -O ${env.BUILD_URL}/artifact/build/libs/integration-service-0.1.0.jar'"
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin  ${mrphostname} 'curl -O ${env.BUILD_URL}/artifact/build/libs/ordering-service-0.1.0.jar'"
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin  ${mrphostname} 'curl -O ${env.BUILD_URL}/artifact/MongoRecords.js'"
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin  ${mrphostname} 'curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP/master/docs/assets/jenkins/env/deploy_mrp_app.sh | sudo bash -'"
            }
        sh "curl -sL -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" http://${mrphostname}:9080/mrp/ -o /dev/null"
    }
```
* Click **Save**

**NOTE:** Since we have implemented CI in the previous lab, any changes made in the code will automatically trigger a new build. You don't have to manually trigger the builds now. We will experiment this in the next task.

* The pipeline shall now be the following

```js
node{
    
    stage ("Checkout") {
        git url: 'https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP.git'
    }
    
    env.JAVA_HOME = "${tool 'JDK 8'}"
    env.PATH = "${env.JAVA_HOME}/bin:${env.PATH}"
    sh 'java -version'
    
    stage ('Build IntegrationService') {
        dir('src/Backend/IntegrationService') {
            sh 'chmod +x gradlew'
            sh './gradlew build'
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/integration-service*.jar', excludes: null
        }
    }
    
    stage ('Build OrderService') {
        dir('src/Backend/OrderService') {
            sh 'chmod +x gradlew'
            sh './gradlew build'
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/ordering-service*.jar', excludes: null
            junit '**/TEST-*.xml'
        }
    }

    stage ('Build Client') {
        dir('src/Clients') {
            sh 'chmod +x gradlew'
            sh './gradlew build'
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/mrp.war', excludes: null
        }
    }
    
    stage ('Save MongoRecords.js') {
        dir('deploy') {
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'MongoRecords.js', excludes: '**/docker'
        }
    }

    def mrphostname
    
    stage ('Get MRP hostname') { 
        mrphostname = input(
            id: 'mrhphostname', message: 'Please enter the MRP VM FQDN', parameters: [
                [$class: 'TextParameterDefinition', defaultValue: 'mrp-deploy.westus.cloudapp.azure.com', description: 'This is the FQDN by which the VM can be remotely accessed', name: 'mrphostname']
                ])
        echo ("MRP HostName: ${mrphostname}")
    }
    
     stage ("ssh") {
        sshagent(['mrpadmin']) {
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin  ${mrphostname} 'curl -O ${env.BUILD_URL}artifact/build/libs/mrp.war'"
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin  ${mrphostname} 'curl -O ${env.BUILD_URL}/artifact/build/libs/integration-service-0.1.0.jar'"
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin  ${mrphostname} 'curl -O ${env.BUILD_URL}/artifact/build/libs/ordering-service-0.1.0.jar'"
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin  ${mrphostname} 'curl -O ${env.BUILD_URL}/artifact/MongoRecords.js'"
            sh "ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -l mrpadmin  ${mrphostname} 'curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP/master/docs/assets/jenkins/env/deploy_mrp_app.sh | sudo bash -'"
            }
        sh "curl -sL -w \"%{http_code}\\n\" http://${mrphostname}:9080/mrp/ -o /dev/null"
    }
}

```

### Taks 5: Connecting the dots

**1.** Go to the source code on your github repository

**2.** Edit the file **src/Clients/Web/index.html**

* You can change the title of the page for example.

![Editing PartsUnlimitedMRP title](<../assets/jenkins/edit_index.png>)

**3.** Click **Commit changes** 

**4.** Navigate to your Jenkins master
```
http://localhost:8080/job/PartsUnlimitedMRP/
```

**5.** If not already there, the pipeline will stop at the stage **Get MRP hostname**

* Click on the step that is paused and enter the FQDN of the MRP machine, this is the one that you have deployed in this lab on Task 2.3.

* Click **Proceed** 

![Enter the FQDN of the deployment machine](<../assets/jenkins/pipeline_wait_for_userinput.png>)

**6.** Wait until the completion of the pipeline 

**7.** Navigate to the following address:

```
http://name_of_the_mrp_deployment_machine:9080/mrp
```
The name of the mrp deployment machine is the name of the machine deployed in Task 2.3

Verify that the Title in the browser is the same than the one you have modified in the code.

Next steps
----------

In this lab, you learned how to implement Continuous Deployment for the Parts Unlimited Application. 
This allows you to reduce the time to go in production and get feedback  if your changes are okay. Implemented with Continuous Integration, the changes performed by te developers are pushed in a continuous manner into production without removing the ability to have a human control.
